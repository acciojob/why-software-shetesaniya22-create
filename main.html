	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
          I want to become a developer because I enjoy solving problems and building things that make life easier for people. 
		  Technology constantly evolves, and being a developer allows me to keep learning and growing with it. I love the creativity
		  and logic involved in coding, and it gives me a sense of accomplishment when my ideas come to life. Most importantly, I want
		  to contribute to creating impactful and innovative digital solutions.
